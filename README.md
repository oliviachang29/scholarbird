## The Problem

With the recent college admissions scandal, a lot of attention has been placed on "elite" institutions and their admissions processes; not as much thought has been given to the fact that for most Americans, college is not _what's most prestigious college I can get into?_ but _will I go to college at all?_. 

What keeps many Americans from attending college? The vast majority of Americans can't afford college tuition without some sort of aid, creating a dilemma: do I spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on college, or get a job and support my family? This shouldn't have to be a choice young adults have to make; there are millions of dollars in scholarships each year waiting to be discovered.

## The Solution

Scholarbird helps you discover scholarships through a UI that's actually nice to use. I developed this over a day using Node.js, React, and Okta. While I've used React Native before, this is my first time using React and Okta. All in all it was a great experience (10/10) and I would totally do it again.

The scholarships are pulled from a Google Sheet using Sheety.co API.

## What's next for Scholarbird

Currently, there are about 200 scholarships in the database. I'm going to be adding more scholarships and more search criteria over the coming weeks! As someone who is beginning the college applications process (current high school junior), I will be sure to update the database as I find more scholarships.
